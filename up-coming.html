<b>1. Date: Sunday,  Oct.18.</B></p>
<p>
Location: Franz Horr Stadium, Vienna, Austria</p> 
<p>
What Is It: The growth of the women’s game in Europe was on full display in France with seven of the eight quarterfinalists at the Women’s World Cup representing UEFA. The final of that tournament was in Lyon, the city where the world’s best women’s club resides.</p><br><hr>
<p>
<b>2. In 2020,</b> Lyon will be targeting a fifth straight triumph. Last season, the club defeated Barcelona in the final to capture a sixth title overall. The team includes the French trio of Wendie Renard, Amandine Henry and Eugenie Le Sommer, England’s Lucy Bronze, Germany’s Dzsenifer Marozsan, the Netherlands’ Shanice van de Sanden, Canada’s Kadeisha Buchanan and Norway’s Ada Hegerberg.

<p><b>3. 2020 Champions League Final-Dec 30,</b> Turkey
Champions League already has so much greatness last season that it will be one of the biggest soccer events 2020.The Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey will host the Champions League Final to be played on May 30.</p>
<p>
Fans are already excited about the event as they are yet not over the excitement from last season’s tournament where we saw PSG’s hilarious upset by Manchester United, Liverpool’s once-in-a-lifetime comeback at Barcelona and promising run of Ajax that met a nightmarish end.</p><br><hr>
<p>
<b>4. 2020 Summer Olympics-July 24</b></p>
<p>While men’s U-23 soccer tournament of the Olympics is always quirky, women’s soccer will be the attraction of the event. Commencing from July 24, the 2020 Summer Olympics will be the second-largest women’s soccer tournament with Germany as the defending champions. Last year, USWNT failed to make it to the finals, losing to Sweden in the quarterfinal but this season they will be popular in Japan.</p>

<p>The soccer 2020 event will be hosted across six Japanese cities. We expect an entertaining tournament especially from team Great Britain that has some of the best women footballers from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. The American women’s team will have to fight it out harder if they expect to make it to the finals.
</p><p>
As the past decade, 2020 soccer events will make the first few memories for the next decade and we are sure there will be enough excitement to keep us occupied this year. Particularly for women’s soccer, the year 2020 holds greater importance, given the Women’s Champions League and Summer Olympics.</p></p><br><hr>
